Notes for getting installation to work on a VM with 64 bit UBUNTU
"$" denotes a command to run in terminal (don't type the $, just what follows)

(1) Install Anaconda: download installer from http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install#linux-install 

--Then type: 

        $ bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

--Now  modify your PATH variable to look for the Anaconda distribution
first (replace "[USERNAME]" with your actual username):

        $ export PATH="/home/[USERNAME]/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
double check that this is where Anaconda ended up:
        $ which python2.7 
this should return /home/[USERNAME]/anaconda/bin/python2.7

--Now make sure that Anaconda and ipython are up to date
        $ conda update conda
        $ conda update ipython

(2) Install fftw2:
         $ sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc

(3) Install lapack, blas, and atlas
        $ sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install liblapack
        $ sudo apt-get install liblas-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

(4) Install git:
        $ sudo apt-get install git

(5) clone the repo

        $ git clone https://github.com/liebannam/pipes

(6) set CFLAGS and ARCHFLAGS
        $ source cython_flags.sh

(8) open up setup.py. Verify that you have uncommented line 46 below option
(1.3) and lines 58-59 below option (2.3) to set the environ and path
variables. Change "[USERNAME]" to your username on line 46. 

(9) compile!
        $ python setup.py build_ext -i

Check to make sure the module loads by starting up an iypthon notebook

        $ ipython --notebook
And then opening one of the notebooks in the examples/ folder. If the module
doesn't load, there is possibly a problem with the PATH variables or referencs
to the location various python modules. Double check that your path variable
points first to the Anaconda distribution by typing
        $ echo $PATH

Then check that setup.py and allthethings.pyx have the right locations.
Still doesn't work? Then ask for help: lieb@math.berkeley.edu.
